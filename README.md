# openmp-lab
OpenMP Lab - CS33 Spring 2018 Reinman 

Lab #4, based on using OpenMP and common optimizations to make the given code run faster. 

Some documentation text files can be found in repo that are logs of speedups obtained with the various optimization attempts.

Final submission averaged around 10-13x speedup on lnxsrv08.seas.ucla.edu
- Used old files
- Final submission could be applied towards the new testing data set/files as long as all "dead code" from OMP_GaussianBlur are uncommented.
